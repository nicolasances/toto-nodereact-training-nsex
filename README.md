This Toto Microservice is a **reacting** to a new Training Session being created.

When a new training session is created, this Microservice will create the exercises for that training session by either:
 * copying the exercises of the last workout that had the same exercises
 * copying the exercises from the plan in case it's the first time the plan is being executed in a workout session
